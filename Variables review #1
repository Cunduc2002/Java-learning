right now I'll be learning about java variables

A variable is a placeholder for some letter or numbers
example:
x = 123 

the most used in college are marked with a *:

*boolean //store true or false
*int //means to store integer

float //fractorial number up to 6-7 digits like 3.141592f
*double //fractorial up to 15 digits like 3.14592653589793

//in short double means double precision and it is more precise 

*String //a sequence for characters like "Hello world"

right now I'll be learning about java variables

A variable is a placeholder for some letter or numbers
example:
x = 123 

the most used in college are marked with a *:

*boolean //store true or false
*int //means to store integer

float //fractorial number up to 6-7 digits like 3.141592f
*double //fractorial up to 15 digits like 3.14592653589793

//in short double means double precision and it is more precise 

*char //only store a single letter ex. 'f'
*String //a sequence for characters like "Hello world"

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

  int x =123;
double y =3.14;
boolean z = true;
Char symbol = @;
String name = "Bro";

System.out.println("Hello " + name);

}

//unlike Python, the identation doesn't matter. The important is the {} and ";" 
signifies how each code are seperated from each other. 

this would results in: 
"Hello Bro"

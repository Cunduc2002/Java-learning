imagine we have two cups. 
Cup 1 has water and 
cup 2 has Kool-Aid

String x = "water";
String y = "Kool-Aid";

To swap the two variables, we can't just switch them both. That will just be like pouring 
the kool-Aid directly into the cup1 that has water and they get all mixed up. 
It doesn't understand that you can pour the water out to put in the another
because it wasn't given the instruction that way or have another cup for it. 

Thus, we need a temporary variable to store one in order to open up space in another.
we create - String temp;

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args {

String x = "water";
String y = "Kool-Aid";
String temp;

temp = x; //we put x inside temp
x = y; //we put y = x while below is y inside temp
y = temp; //y put inside temp thux, switching the position

System.out.println("x: " + x);
System.out.println("y: " + y);

}

the results would be 
"x: Kool-Aid"
"y: Water"
